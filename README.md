# n8n Webhook Load Tester üöÄ

A simple Streamlit app to test concurrent webhook executions on your n8n workflows.

## Features

- üîÑ **Async requests** - Uses Python asyncio and aiohttp for true concurrent execution
- üìä **Real-time monitoring** - Watch concurrent executions in real-time
- üìà **Detailed metrics** - Success/failure rates, timing, and workload info
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable** - Adjust number of concurrent requests via slider

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **n8n workflow** - You need an active n8n workflow with a webhook trigger
   - The workflow should be created with the webhook path `/load-test`
   - It includes a random 1-5 second delay to simulate workload
   - Returns a "work complete" message with timing info

2. **Python 3.8+** installed

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cgorricho/n8n-webhook-load-tester.git
cd n8n-webhook-load-tester

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

You can set your webhook URL in two ways:

1. **Environment variable** (recommended):
```bash
export N8N_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/load-test"
```

2. **In the app** - Enter it in the sidebar when running

## Usage

### Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the app

1. **Enter your webhook URL** in the sidebar (or set via environment variable)
2. **Set the number of requests** using the slider (1-50)
3. **Click "Start Load Test"** to begin
4. **Monitor** the concurrent executions in real-time
5. **Review results** including success rate, timing, and individual request details

## How it works

### The n8n Workflow

The test workflow:
1. Receives a POST request via webhook
2. Generates a random delay between 1-5 seconds
3. Waits for that duration (simulating work)
4. Returns a JSON response with:
   - `message`: "work complete"
   - `delaySeconds`: The random delay used
   - `startTime` and `endTime`: ISO timestamps
   - `workloadDescription`: Human-readable description

### The Streamlit App

The app:
1. Creates async HTTP requests using `aiohttp`
2. Launches all requests concurrently
3. Tracks how many are running at any given time
4. Records the maximum concurrent executions
5. Displays detailed results for each request

## Metrics Explained

- **Currently Running**: Number of webhook calls executing right now
- **Max Concurrent**: Highest number of simultaneous executions during the test
- **Successful**: Requests that completed successfully
- **Failed**: Requests that encountered errors
- **Avg Time**: Average response time across all requests
- **Total Time**: Total elapsed time for the entire test

## Use Cases

- Test your n8n instance's concurrency limits
- Validate webhook performance under load
- Understand how n8n queues executions
- Compare Cloud vs self-hosted concurrency behavior
- Debug race conditions in workflows
